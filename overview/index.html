are on ZecSec&rsquo;s radar. These are not necessarily being worked on as part of
ZecSec, but are being spotlighted here as our recommendations for ecosystem-wide
priorities.</p><h3 id=scalable-privacy-for-wallets>Scalable Privacy For Wallets</h3><p>A challenge faced by all cryptocurrencies that aim to offer strong, formal
privacy guarantees is: how can wallets&rsquo; find their funds and make their funds
spendable quickly and efficiently?</p><p>At present, Zcash uses &ldquo;trial decryption&rdquo;, where the wallet must try to decrypt
every transaction on the blockchain to find the ones that belong to it. There are many
alternatives to this design with varying levels of privacy and scalability.
We&rsquo;ve surveyed them in our post, <a href=https://zecsec.com/posts/scalable-private-money-needs-scalable-private-messaging/>Scalable Private Money Needs Scalable Anonymous Messaging</a>.</p><h3 id=unintentional-andor-forced-use-of-transparent-transactions>Unintentional and/or Forced Use of Transparent Transactions</h3><p>Usage of transparent transactions on the Zcash blockchain remains high.
Transparent addresses and transactions offer users the ability to transact
transparently, with consent, whenever they wish to do so. However, the high
transparent usage might be a sign that some users misunderstand the privacy
level provided by transparent transactions, or that users are forced into making
parts of their transactions transparent by third-parties who do not fully
support shielded addresses.</p><p>I know of at least one anecdote where someone put themselves at risk by using a
transparent address, because they thought &ldquo;Zcash is private.&rdquo;</p><p>In our view, this problem should be tackled with (a) research into how
frequently users misunderstand the privacy properties of using transparent
addresses, (b) UX design within wallets that communicates privacy levels clearly
and simply, (c) support requests from the community to third parties and extra
engineering effort to increase shielded adoption, (d) an eventual removal of
transparent addresses, replaced by the use of viewing keys.</p><h3 id=secure-messaging-with-the-memo-field>Secure Messaging with the Memo Field</h3><p>A popular use case for Zcash&rsquo;s memo field is sending messages. However, Zcash&rsquo;s
memo field currently lacks several properties that are required for secure
messaging. For example, it is not signed, so wallets cannot be sure of messages'
origins, and it is not forward-secure, so if keys are compromised, all past
messages can be decrypted.</p><p>We would like to see the memo field extended with more features so that it is
easy to build messengers on top of it with Signal-like security properties.</p><h3 id=mitigating-c-memory-corruption-bug-risk-in-zcashd>Mitigating C++ Memory Corruption Bug Risk in Zcashd</h3><p>The main fullnode implementation of Zcash is written in C++, which puts it at
risk of entire classes of security vulnerabilities that cannot exist within
projects that are written in safer languages, like Rust. Deprecating the legacy
<code>zcashd</code> codebase should be a priority, to be replaced by <code>zebra</code>. These
risks could also be mitigated with better fuzzing of <code>zcashd</code>&rsquo;s code, but it&rsquo;s
probably better to get rid of the C++ code entirely.</p><h3 id=easing-consensus-rule-security-review>Easing Consensus Rule Security Review</h3><p>A security engineer entering the Zcash ecosystem for the first time is faced
with the daunting task of <em>finding</em> the code that implements Zcash&rsquo;s consensus
rules. As a result, a large portion of audit time is used inefficiently, spent
finding and understanding consensus rule code.</p><p>The efficiency of future consensus rule audits can be improved by labeling the
locations of all consensus rules in the code. Electric Coin Company has already
<a href=https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/5912>started on this project</a>. Labeling
more consensus rules is on <a href=https://zecsec.com/posts/zecsec-roadmap-for-2023/>ZecSec&rsquo;s 2023 roadmap</a>, but hopefully all maintainers of consensus
rule code will be able to contribute to this project.</p><h2 id=projects-in-scope-alphabetical-order>Projects In Scope (alphabetical order)</h2><p>ZecSec aims to eventually provide security support for all Zcash-tangential
projects that are currently used, are in development, or run important
infrastructure for the community. Listed below are all of the projects that are
potentially in scope.</p><p>Note that security support has not yet been &ldquo;rolled out&rdquo; to most of these
projects yet! For more details on prioritization, see our <a href=https://zecsec.com/posts/zecsec-roadmap-for-2023/>2023 roadmap</a>. If your Zcash-related project is missing

possible to violate the soundness property of the zero-knowledge proving system
originally used by Zcash. If this bug was exploited, it would have allowed for
the forgery of Zcash funds, limited by the <a href=https://electriccoin.co/blog/turnstile-enforcement-against-counterfeiting/>turnstile
design</a>
that was built as a defense-in-depth measure against these kinds of attacks.</p><p>This bug was assigned CVE-2019-7167.</p><p><a href=https://electriccoin.co/blog/zcash-counterfeiting-vulnerability-successfully-remediated/>Disclosure Blog Post</a></p><h3 id=side-channel-attacks-on-zcash-node-transaction-receivers>Side-Channel Attacks on Zcash Node Transaction Receivers</h3><p>In an <a href=https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/220>academic paper</a>, Florian TramÃ¨r, Dan
Boneh, and Kenneth G. Paterson explored the use of timing, traffic analysis, and
error-message side-channels to de-anonymize nodes in receipt of transactions.</p><p>They found that when a Zcash node successfully decrypted a transaction, but the
note commitment check failed, the node would send an error message back to the
attacker, indicating to the attacker that the node had the key required to
decrypt the transaction. Additionally, since the P2P message processing all
happened on the same thread, an attacker could measure the response time of a
&ldquo;ping&rdquo; message to determine if the note commitment check was happening; another
way to confirm the node had the correct decryption key. Through either of these
approaches, it was possible for an attacker to conclude that a known shielded
address belonged to the victim node.</p><p>The vulnerability in Zcash was assigned CVE-2019-16930, and there is a
corresponding <a href=https://z.cash/support/security/announcements/security-announcement-2019-09-24/>security
announcement</a>.</p><h3 id=sapling-woodchipper>Sapling Woodchipper</h3><p>&ldquo;<a href=https://saplingwoodchipper.github.io/>Sapling Woodchipper</a>&rdquo; is a name given

fill up blocks on the Zcash blockchain. It was assigned CVE-2019-1636 by its

transaction fee structure, specified in <a href=https://zips.z.cash/zip-0317>ZIP-317</a>.</p><h3 id=internalh-collision-vulnerability>InternalH Collision Vulnerability</h3><p>In the original <a href=https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/349>Zerocash paper</a> that Zcash
