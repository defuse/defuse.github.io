It&amp;rsquo;s time for the first monthly update on the Zcash Ecosystem
Security grant. This October, we saw the completion of a full security audit of
&lt;a href="https://ywallet.app/">Ywallet&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ywallet&amp;rsquo;s fast scanning algorithm makes it an attractive option for users facing
long delays due to the recent high usage of the Zcash blockchain. It had also
received the least security review among the Zcash wallets, so we
decided to prioritize it as the first project to be audited for this grant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The audit report was delivered to Ywallet&amp;rsquo;s developers today and it will be
published for the community to see after all necessary issues have been
appropriately remediated.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-next">What&amp;rsquo;s next?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In November, we will continue the focus on wallets, this time reviewing
&lt;a href="https://github.com/adityapk00/zecwallet-light-cli">zecwallet-lite-cli&lt;/a>. This
library and command-line tool is the basis of the popular ZecWallet-lite wallet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After this, we plan to take a short detour to focus on some of the smaller and
earlier-stage community projects, before putting our focus back on wallets to
review ZecWallet-lite proper, Nighthawk, and others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;d like your project to be included in our upcoming audit schedule, please
shoot an email to &lt;a href="mailto:zecsec@defuse.ca">zecsec@defuse.ca&lt;/a> with a link to your source code repository.&lt;/p></description><author>trandcanh@gmail.com (Calvin Tran)</author><guid>https://zecsec.com/posts/october-update/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Oct 2022 08:13:14 -0700</pubDate></item><item><title>Hello, World!</title><link>https://zecsec.com/posts/my-first-post/</link><description>&lt;p>Hi!&lt;/p>
