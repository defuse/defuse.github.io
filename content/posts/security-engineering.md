At Zcon4, I gave a talk that summarizes the results of my Zcash ecosystem
security grant and provides an overview of security engineering, drawing on
knowledge from safety-critical industries such as aviation. 

This talk should be useful to anyone working to set up a security program in
their organization or looking to improve their team's security practices.
Experienced security engineers may be interested in the safety engineering
concepts that also apply to security engineering.
