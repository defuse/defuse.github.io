A critical vulnerability has been discovered in `libbitcoin-explorer`
(command-line tool `bx`), known as ["milk sad"](https://milksad.info/).

**If at any point in the past, you may have used the `bx seed` tool to generate
your crypto wallet's seed phrase, you must IMMEDIATELY generate a new seed
phrase using an up-to-date secure wallet and move your funds to the new
wallet.**

The bug in `bx seed` is simple: it used only the system's time as a source of
randomness when generating seed phrases. As a result, `bx seed` could only ever
produce one of around 4 billion seed phrases. This set of 4 billion seed phrases
can easily be re-generated by attackers, and funds are currently being stolen
from wallets using one of these seed phrases.

Similar bugs have existed in Cake Wallet and Trust Wallet, see the [details in
the milk sad discoverers' technical
writeup](https://milksad.info/disclosure.html). If you used those wallets, I
recommend re-generating a new seed phrase as well.

As far as I know, other wallets are not affected by this bug. To protect
yourself against these kinds of bugs, be sure to only use a wallet which has
undergone an independent security review.
